The Contact Form Application enables users to submit their contact information through a structured form while incorporating validation mechanisms to ensure that all required fields are properly filled before submission. Upon successful submission, users receive feedback on the status of their submission, confirming the successful recording of their data. Additionally, the application utilizes a mock API to simulate data storage and retrieval, providing a realistic environment for testing and demonstrating its functionality.
